            <h2><u>11 OF THE MOST AMAZING HISTORICAL WONDERS IN INDIA</u></h2><br><br>
            <h3>RANI KI VAV, GUJARAT</h3>
            <img src="../Resources/Rani-ki-Vav.jpg" alt="" id="ll">
            <p>Rani Ki Vav, or the Queen's Stepwell, is one of the many UNESCO World Heritage Sites that the state of Gujarat is home to.
               It was constructed by Rani Udaymati in memory of her husband, King Bhima 1, of the Chalukya or Solanki dynasty, which existed between 950 and 1300 CE. Rani Ki Vav is situated on the banks of the Saraswati river.
               A fine specimen of the Maru-Gurjara style of architecture, UNESCO describes the Rani-Ki-Vav as displaying the pinnacle of craftsmanship in stepwell construction. It has been designed as an inverted temple and is divided into seven levels, with sculptural panels of unmatched artistic quality.
               A flight of stairs built in distinct geometrical patterns leads visitors to the Rani ki Vav. One can also see numerous stone columns at the end of the stairs.
               Rani-Ki-Vav features on the new hundred rupee note issued by the Reserve Bank of India.
               Out of the seven levels of Rani Ki Vav, the fourth is the deepest and leads into a rectangular tank, measuring 9.5 metres by 9.4 metres, at a depth of 23 metres.
               The Rani Ki Vav stepwell is believed to have been buried underground owing to a severe flood in the Saraswati river. It was resurrected after decades of painstaking clearance and restoration by the Archaeological Survey of India from 1958 onwards.
               The Rani Ki Vav World Heritage Site houses 500 principal sculptures and over a thousand minor sculptures, depicting religious, mythological and non-sacred imagery.
               Most of the sculptures at Rani Ki Vav are in devotion to Lord Vishnu, in various forms like Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, Lord Narsimh and Lord Vaman.
               The walls of the different stories of the massive stepwell are adorned with intricately carved sculptures while the various sections of the stepwell are joined with the support of beautifully carved pillars.
               The pillars at Rani ki Vav are intricately carved with imposing floral patterns and sculptures of various gods and goddesses. The upper portion of the pillars have sculptures of women carved in a manner that it appears as if their shoulders are supporting the roof.

            <h3>HAWA MAHAL, JAIPUR, RAJASTHAN</h3>
            <img src="../Resources/HAWAMAHAL.jpeg" alt="" id="ll">
            <p>Hawa Mahal, also known as the Palace of Winds, is a five-story palace in Jaipur, India. 
                The word "Hawa Mahal" translates to "Wind Palace". The palace was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of the founder of Jaipur. 
                It's made of red and pink sandstone and is 15 meters tall.
                The Hawa Mahal is the world's tallest building without a foundation. It has a curved, pyramidal shape that leans at an 87 degree angle, which has helped it remain standing for centuries. The palace is dedicated to Lord Krishna. 
                The Hawa Mahal has over 950 intricate latticework windows that resemble honeycomb. The windows were designed to allow the royal ladies of the time to watch street scenes and processions without being seen. 
                Some say the Hawa Mahal is "floating" because it's not anchored to the ground, but rather attached to a wall that is.

            <h3>HAMPI, KARNATAKA</h3>
            <img src="../Resources/HAMPI.jpg" alt="" id="ll">
            
            <p>History and mythology come to life in the legendary lost city of Hampi. Once the powerhouse of an ancient kingdom and an auspicious temple town, Hampi is located on the banks of the mighty Tungabhadra river.
                A queen's bath, a spectacular Lotus Palace (shown here), a royal stable and a temple which is said to have been where the wedding of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati took place, this UNESCO World Heritage site reveals a facet of history at every turn.

                Although in ruins, the magnificent structures stand in testimony to Hampi's rich past under the powerful Vijayanagara empire, which existed between 1336 and 1646 AD.

                Hampi finds mention in the Hindu epic Ramayana as well. It is said to be the location of Kishkinda, the monkey kingdom. It is no wonder then that Hampi has ranked second in New York Times' must-visit destination list for 2019.
                Hampi was the last capital of the Vijayanagara kingdom, one of the most significant in Southern India. Its wealthy kings built exquisite temples and palaces that gained the admiration of travellers in the 14th and 16th centuries.
                Though plundered later, Hampi still retains more than 1600 monuments, including palaces, forts, memorial structures, temples, shrines, pillared halls, baths and gateways.
                Hampi's architectural ruins are set against a surreal landscape. Dotted with heaps of giant boulders perched precariously over kilometres of undulating terrain, it attracts rock-climbers, trekkers and other adventure sport enthusiasts.
                The rust hues of these rocks are offset by the jade green of palm groves, banana plantations and paddy fields. Today, this laid-back town is a tourist hub, and is flocked by devotees, adventure-lovers and thrill-seekers.
                The Stone Chariot is one of the finest examples of the Vijayanagara style of architecture. It is said to be a shrine of Garuda, a bird-like mythical being believed to be Lord Vishnu’s vehicle.
                Legend says that the wheels of the chariot, decorated with intricate floral patterns, were once capable of being turned. Even now, looking at its spokes, it seems as if they would turn at a divine command.
                The chariot, the main temple, and a few smaller structures are housed within a vast walled courtyard with three imposing gateways. The main temple is dedicated to Lord Vitthala, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu.
                carved musical pillars, which are said to produce the sounds of 81 different musical instruments when tapped with a wooden stick.
                According to folklore, the British were so fascinated by the pillars that they took a few down to investigate how the music was produced.

            <h3>KHAJURAHO MONUMENTS, CHHATARPUR, MADHYA PRADESH</h3>
            <img src="../Resources/khajuraho.webp" alt="" id="ll">
            <p>One among the finest example of temple architecture, the Khajuraho group of monuments are icons of religious, artistic and aesthetic genius, all molded and featured at once.

                The temples were built during the 10th and 11th century by the Hindu Chandela dynasty and are beautifully embellished with refined sculptures and neat proportions, both to the exterior and interior of the buildings.
                
                Out of the 85 original monuments, only 20 have survived the weathering of time. The sculpture on the walls exhibits a huge number of deities and their corresponding attendants that depict their actions or exploits.

            <h3>JANTAR MANTAR, JAIPUR, RAJASTHAN</h3>
            <img src="../Resources/JANTARMANTAR.jpg" alt="" id="ll">
            <p>Built in 1724 by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur, Jantar Mantar is one of the five astronomical observatories built by the king in Northern India. Its striking combinations of geometric forms have caught the attention of architects, artists and art historians from around the world. It was designed for the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye. It is a part of the tradition of the Ptolemaic positional astronomy, which was common in a lot of civilisations.

                Jantar Mantar comprises 13 astronomy instruments that were used to predict the movements and timings of the planets, the sun and the moon. Astronomical tables and charts were compiled to get an accurate idea of the celestial bodies. The major attractions of Jantar Mantar are Misra Yantra, Samrat Yantra, and Jayaprakash Yantra.
                
                The Samrat Yantra is a large sundial that stands parallel to the earth�s axis and helps to check the time. The Jayaprakash Yantra is shaped like a hemisphere and is used to align the position of stars to markings. Meanwhile, the Misra Yantra is used to find the shortest and the longest days of the year. All of these instruments have been built with brick and rubble and have been plastered with lime. Tourists can also visit a small Bhairava temple that is located towards the east of Jantar Mantar.
                
                Legend has it that Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II was fascinated by the movement of celestial bodies and thus commissioned the construction of Jantar Mantar so the distance, location and speed of these could be calculated.</p>

            <h3>RUINS OF NALANDA UNIVERSITY, BIHAR</h3>
            <img src="../Resources/nalanda.webp" alt="" id="ll">
            <p>More than 500 years before Oxford University was founded, India's Nalanda University was home to nine million books and attracted 10,000 students from around the world.
                Founded in 427 CE, Nalanda is considered the world's first residential university, a sort of medieval Ivy League institution home to nine million books that attracted 10,000 students from across Eastern and Central Asia. They gathered here to learn medicine, logic, mathematics and – above all – Buddhist principles from some of the era's most revered scholars. As the Dalai Lama once stated: "The source of all the [Buddhist] knowledge we have, has come from Nalanda."
                Aryabhata, considered the father of Indian mathematics, is speculated to have headed the university in the 6th Century CE. "We believe that Aryabhata was the first to assign zero as a digit, a revolutionary concept, which simplified mathematical computations and helped evolve more complex avenues such as algebra and calculus," said Anuradha Mitra, a Kolkata-based professor of mathematics. "Without zero, we wouldn't have computers," she added. "He also did pioneering works in extracting square and cubic roots, and applications of trigonometrical functions to spherical geometry. He was also the first to attribute radiance of the moon to reflected sunlight." 
            </p>
            <img src="../Resources/nalanda2.webp" alt="" id="ll">
            <p>
                The acclaimed Chinese Buddhist monk and traveller Xuanzang studied and taught at Nalanda. When he returned to China in 645 CE, he carried back a wagonload of 657 Buddhist scriptures from Nalanda. Xuanzang would go on to become one of the world's most influential Buddhist scholars, and he would translate a portion of these volumes into Chinese to create his life's treatise, whose central idea was that the whole world is but a representation of the mind. His Japanese disciple, Dosho, would later introduce this doctrine to Japan, and it would spread further into the Sino-Japanese world, where it would remain as a major religion ever since. As a result, Xuanzang has been credited as "the monk who brought Buddhism East". 
                The archaeological remains of Nalanda arenow a Unesco World Heritage site. In the 1190s, the university was destroyed by a marauding troop of invaders led by Turko-Afghan military general Bakhtiyar Khilji, who sought to extinguish the Buddhist centre of knowledge during his conquest of northern and eastern India. The campus was so vast that the fire set on by the attackersis said to have burned for three months. Today, the 23-hectare excavated site is likely a mere fraction of the original campus, but ambling through its multitude of monasteries and temples evokes a feeling of what it must have been like to learn at this fabled place.

            <h3>TABO CAVES, HIMACHAL PRADESH</h3>
            <img src="../Resources/Tabo-Himachal-Pradesh.jpg" alt="" id="ll">
            <p>Tabo Caves lie just opposite Tabo village on Spiti Valley. Carved out from the hills, these caves were used for meditation by Buddhist monks besides serving as their refuge during winters. Some of the larger caves functioned as assembly halls while the smaller caves were used as dwellings. While exploring these caves, you will come across several prayer flags which indicate that meditation is still practiced inside these caves. The atmosphere inside is as you would expect at such places: calm and quiet.</p>

            <h3>SANCHI STUPA, RAISEN DISTRICT, MADHYA PRADESH</h3>
            <img src="../Resources/SANCHISTUPA.jpeg" alt="" id="ll">
            <p>The Great Stupa at Sanchi is a Buddhist complex and one of the oldest stone structures in India. The Mauryan emperor Ashoka the Great commissioned the stupa in the 3rd century BCE. The stupa is located on a hilltop in Sanchi Town, Raisen District, Madhya Pradesh.
                The stupa's hemispherical dome is the main feature of the site and is also known as Anda. The dome is surrounded by a railing and four gateways, each adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures. The domed shape of the stupa represents a person seated in meditation, much like the Buddha when he achieved Enlightenment. 
                The stupa, temples, viharas, and stambha at Sanchi are among the oldest and most mature examples of aniconic arts and free-standing architecture. They document the history of Buddhism from the 3rd century BCE to the 12th century CE. 
                The stupa was discovered in 1818 by General Taylor, after lying abandoned for 600 years. The site was overgrown with vegetation, and excavations began in a disorganized fashion until the Archaeological Survey of India took control.
