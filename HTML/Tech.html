                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Modern India has had a strong focus on science and technology, realising that it is a key element
                        for economic growth. India ranks third among the most attractive investment destinations for
                        technology transactions in the world. With more and more multinational companies setting up
                        their R&D centres in India, the sector has seen an uptrend in investment in recent years.</p>
                    <p>India is among the top countries globally in the field of scientific research, positioned as one
                        of the top five nations in the field of space exploration. The country has regularly undertaken
                        space missions, including missions to the moon and the famed Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle
                        (PSLV). India is likely to take a leading role in launching satellites for the SAARC nations,
                        generating revenue by offering its space facilities for use to other countries</p>
                    <p>The government has introduced multiple policies aimed at projecting India as a science and
                        technology powerhouse and promoting both public and private sector involvement in the R&D
                        practice. As a result, India's gross expenditure on R&D (GERD) has been consistently increasing
                        over the years. The government has also implemented several fellowship schemes to nurture the
                        human capacity for advanced research in the country.</p>

                The Indian IT industry is booming. Many Indian startups contribute to future technology trends such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Quantum Computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

                The IT industry is a major contributor to the Indian economy. India’s booming IT industry makes her a global leader. India accounts for more than half of the US sourcing business.

                This article discusses the key technologies that India can contribute to its future development, and how you can benefit from them.
            </p><br><br><br><br><br>
            <h2>IT Technology in India: The Past</h2><br><br><br>
            <p>India was known to fall short in all areas, especially economic growth. In the last decade, India made massive improvements in Information Technology (IT) to the point that the Indian software industry gained global attention.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>1970s</h3><b><br></b>
            <p>The growth started in the 1970s when it became a destination for software-sourcing businesses. This boom created massive job opportunities for the infant Indian IT industry. The IT revolution was sudden and unknown to many.</p>
             <br><br><br>
            <h3>The 1980s and 1990s</h3><br><br>
            <p>In the 1980s, India entered the “prepackaged software” industry. There were not enough trained engineers to build custom software.
                The 1990s saw the introduction of software services made in India. There was the creation of some infant IT industries, the birth of international companies of Indian origin, and the establishment of various development centers in India.</p>
             <br><br><br>   
            <h3>2000 – Present</h3><br><br>
            <p>The Indian IT industry became a powerful influence since this period. There was impressive growth in technological innovations and business strategies.</p>
